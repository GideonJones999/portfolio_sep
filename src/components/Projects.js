            ! It was a ton of fun, especially with layering the images on top of
            one another. It was also a good way to integrate Firebase with the
            Google login and the online scores. It was made using Angular in
            April and May of 2021.

            that we made in High School as a simple RPG in the C# console. We
            both learned a lot about classes and inheritance, which was a ton of
            fun. We both found that our High School Programming class was too
            simple, so after we quickly finished our work we would work on this
            small project. Made from September to October of 2019.
